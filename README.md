# claude-pod

> Docker sandbox for Claude Code CLI. Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` safely — Claude only sees the project folder you launched from. Unofficial sandbox.

## Install & Run

```sh
# Clone this repo (once)
git clone https://github.com/ryanpeach/claude-pod.git ~/bin/claude-pod

# Build claude-pod Docker image (once)
cd ~/bin/claude-pod && ./install.sh

# Navigate to the project you want to build with Claude Code
# cd ~/projects/awesome-new-project

# Launch Claude Code safely inside claude-pod container in "auto-approval" mode
~/bin/claude-pod/claude-pod claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Docker is the only requirement. The install path (`~/bin/claude-pod`) is just an example — put it wherever you want.

**The outcome:** You can run Claude Code in auto-approval mode, skipping the need to approve every single change, without exposing your whole machine. `claude-pod` launches Claude inside a Docker container with only your current project folder mounted, so Claude can read and edit that project, but not your home directory, SSH keys, other projects, or host shell. This turns the main risk from “Claude can touch my machine” into “Claude can touch this project folder.” Read more about [what is and isn't isolated](#what-is-and-isnt-isolated).

## Requirements

**Just Docker.** 

Claude Code runs inside the container, not on your host — you do not need Node.js, npm, or the `claude` CLI installed on your machine. The host stays untouched apart from one state folder (`~/.claude-pod/`) that exists only to keep your login across container restarts.

## What it actually does

The whole tool is four tiny files:

- **`Dockerfile`** — `node:24-slim` + `git` + `curl` + `less` + `jq` + `gh` + `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`.
- **`claude-pod`** — one `docker run` command that mounts your current directory and nothing else.
- **`install.sh`** — checks Docker and builds the image. Doesn't touch any system path; the tool stays self-contained in this folder.
- **`uninstall.sh`** — removes the image and `~/.claude-pod/` (auth + session history) after confirmation. Lists what it doesn't touch so you can clean those up yourself.

## Usage

Call the script using its full or relative path from any project:

```sh
cd ~/Projects/anything
~/bin/claude-pod/claude-pod
```

You land in a bash shell at the same path your project lives at on the host (e.g. `/Users/you/Projects/anything`), with `claude` on `PATH`. Run it however you like:

```sh
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Alternatively, you may skip the shell and go straight into Claude. Anything you pass to `claude-pod` is run inside the container instead of bash. So this drops you directly into Claude in one command, and exits the container when Claude exits:

```sh
~/bin/claude-pod/claude-pod claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

To exit, type `exit`.

### Aliases

For your convenience, you can add the following aliases to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.):

```sh
alias claude-pod=~/bin/claude-pod/claude-pod                                  
alias cc='~/bin/claude-pod/claude-pod claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'  
```

The shell-first form is more flexible, since you can run `npm install`, dev server, tests, then `claude` directly inside the container, so it is the default.

### First launch (login)

The first time you start Claude inside the pod, it will print a login URL. Open it in your host browser, complete the login, paste the verification code back into the container, and you're done. The session persists in `~/.claude-pod/` and survives container restarts — you only do this once per machine.

### Exposing ports

By default, `claude-pod` doesn't publish any ports to the host (outbound traffic is still unrestricted — see [What is and isn't isolated](#what-is-and-isnt-isolated)). Map ports through with the `PORTS` environment variable:

```sh
# Map a single port (127.0.0.1:3000 -> container:3000)
PORTS=3000 claude-pod

# Map multiple ports
PORTS="3000 5173" claude-pod

# Map a specific host port to a different container port
PORTS="8080:80" claude-pod

# Or, alternatively, without using aliases
PORTS="5173:5173" ~/bin/claude-pod
```

> **Bind your dev server to `0.0.0.0` inside the container, not `localhost`.** Most dev servers default to `localhost`, which means they only listen on the container's own loopback — your host browser can't reach them even with `PORTS=...` set. Common fixes:
> - **Vite:** `npm run dev -- --host` (or `vite --host 0.0.0.0`)
> - **Next.js:** `next dev -H 0.0.0.0`
> - **Create React App / webpack-dev-server:** `HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start`
> - **Django:** `manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
> - **Rails:** `rails s -b 0.0.0.0`
>
> The host-side mapping is still `127.0.0.1`-only (forced by `claude-pod`), so binding `0.0.0.0` inside the container does not expose your dev server to your LAN.

### Updating or pinning the Claude Code version

By default, `install.sh` fetches whatever's currently `latest` on npm, bypassing Docker's cache for that step. To update, just re-run:

```sh
cd ~/bin/claude-pod
./install.sh
```

To pin a specific version, set `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`:

```sh
CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=2.0.0 ./install.sh
```

Pinned versions cache normally across rebuilds. The script prints the resolved version after each build, so you always know what you got.

### Customizing the image

The image is intentionally minimal: `node:24-slim` + `git` + `curl` + `less` + `jq` + `gh` + Claude Code. Nothing language-specific. Anything your projects need (Python, build tools, other toolchains) you add yourself — edit the `Dockerfile` and re-run `./install.sh`.

## What is and isn't isolated

**Safe from Claude:**
- Everything outside the project folder you launched from. `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.zshrc`, browser data, other projects — all unreachable.
- The host shell. No way to execute commands on your host machine.

**Still exposed:**
- **The project folder itself.** Anything inside it — `.env`, `.git/config` (which can carry credentials for private remotes), private keys committed by mistake, `node_modules`, sibling worktrees, scratch files — is fully readable *and* writable by code running in the container. Don't run `claude-pod` from a folder whose contents you wouldn't trust the AI (or a malicious dependency it just installed) to see and modify.
- **The network.** Outbound is unrestricted. A malicious payload could exfiltrate the project contents or burn your Anthropic API quota.
- **Your Anthropic login** (stored in `~/.claude-pod/` on the host, separate from any host Claude install, shared across sandboxed projects).

**Where Claude can actually write** — two paths, both intentional bind mounts:
- The project folder, bind-mounted at the same path inside the container (`$PWD:$PWD`). Edits land on your host's disk directly, no copy.
- `~/.claude-pod/` on the host, mounted at `/home/claude-pod/.claude`. Holds the auth token and session history.

> Because the current directory (`$PWD`) is mounted into the container, **avoid running this tool from directories like root (`/`) or `/etc` or other sensitive ones**. In such cases you are giving the AI access to your entire machine or to other sensitive data, defeating the purpose of the sandbox. Always `cd` into your specific project folder first.

Everywhere else Claude writes is either in the container's ephemeral filesystem (discarded on exit thanks to `--rm`) or simply has no path to land at — the Linux kernel's mount namespace makes any other host directory invisible to the container. Symlinks inside the project folder pointing to `~/.ssh` or `/etc/passwd` appear broken for the same reason: those targets aren't mounted, so the container can't see them.

> **Hardlinks are different.** A hardlink is a second name for an existing inode on the same filesystem. If a file inside your project folder is hardlinked to a sensitive file elsewhere on the same filesystem (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`), the container *can* reach it through the hardlink — the bind-mount exposes the inode, not just the path. This requires the hardlink to already exist in the project folder, so it's a real concern only when you're inspecting code from an untrusted source. Treat unfamiliar projects with the same caution you'd apply to running their code directly: don't run `claude-pod` inside a folder you don't trust.

The tradeoff: the worst case becomes "something bad happens to one project folder," which is recoverable from git, instead of "my entire home directory is exposed."

## Side effects outside the project folder

Everything this repo causes to exist outside the project you launch it from:

- `~/.claude-pod/` on your host — auth token, settings, and per-project session/conversation history (transcripts can include code snippets and command output Claude saw). Auth and settings are shared across projects (one login, ever); session history lives under `~/.claude-pod/projects/<encoded-host-path>/`, one folder per project, using the same encoding host-Claude uses — so if you ever switch to a host install, you can copy the folders over and keep your transcripts. This is *not* a host Claude install; it's a state directory for the container's Claude, kept on the host so it survives restarts.
- Docker image `claude-pod` (~700 MB) and its layers, plus the `node:24-slim` base image, in Docker's image store.
- Docker build cache from `apt-get` and `npm install` steps.
- Outbound network during build: Docker Hub, Debian apt mirrors, npm registry. During runtime: `api.anthropic.com` and whatever your project code reaches (network is unrestricted).
- While a session is running: one container process, and any ports you explicitly mapped via `PORTS` bound on `127.0.0.1`.

No `sudo`, no writes to `/usr/local/`, `/etc/`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/Library/`, your existing `~/.claude/`, or anywhere else on the host.

## Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes `~/.claude-pod/` and the `claude-pod` image after confirmation. Tells you exactly what it isn't touching (`node:24-slim`, build cache, this repo) and how to clean those up yourself.

If you added a shell alias for convenience (e.g. `alias claude-pod=...` or `alias cc=...` in `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`), remove that line too — `uninstall.sh` doesn't touch your shell rc files.

## Platforms

The wrapper is portable POSIX bash + Docker. It should work on any host with a recent Docker:

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel) with Docker Desktop, OrbStack, or Colima — primary development target.
- **Linux** with Docker Engine or Docker Desktop — bind mounts and `--user` UID/GID map directly here, the most native experience.
- **Windows + WSL2** with Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend — run `claude-pod` from inside a WSL distribution's bash shell.

**Native Windows** (`cmd.exe` / PowerShell) is not supported. The wrapper is a bash script and uses POSIX tools (`id`, etc.); use WSL2 instead.

If a platform doesn't behave as expected, please open an issue.
