# claude-pod

Unofficial Docker sandbox for Anthropic's Claude Code CLI. Runs [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) inside a container so it can only see the project folder you launched it from. Lets you use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (auto-approve) without putting the rest of your machine at risk.

## Requirements

**Just Docker.** Claude Code runs inside the container, not on your host — you do **not** need Node.js, npm, or the `claude` CLI installed on your machine. The host stays untouched apart from one state folder (`~/.claude-pod/`) that exists only to keep your login across container restarts.

## What it actually does

The whole tool is four tiny files:

- **`Dockerfile`** — `node:lts-slim` + `git` + `curl` + `less` + `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, runs as a non-root user.
- **`claude-pod`** — one `docker run` command that mounts your current directory and nothing else.
- **`install.sh`** — checks Docker and builds the image. Doesn't touch any system path; the tool stays self-contained in this folder.
- **`uninstall.sh`** — removes the image and `~/.claude-pod/` (auth + session history) after confirmation. Lists what it doesn't touch so you can clean those up yourself.

Read them. They are short on purpose.

## Setup (one time)

```sh
git clone <this repo> ~/tools/claude-pod
cd ~/tools/claude-pod
./install.sh
```

That builds the `claude-pod` Docker image. Nothing else is installed on your system. Move or rename the folder anytime — only the image tag matters at runtime.

## Usage

Call the script by full path from any project:

```sh
cd ~/Projects/anything
~/tools/claude-pod/claude-pod
```

Prefer something shorter? Add an alias to your shell rc file:

```sh
alias claude-pod=~/tools/claude-pod/claude-pod
```

You land in a bash shell at the same path your project lives at on the host (e.g. `/Users/you/Projects/anything`), with `claude` on `PATH`. Run it however you like:

```sh
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

A web app started inside the container on port `3000` is reachable from your host machine at `http://localhost:3000`. To exit, type `exit`.

### Skip the shell, go straight into Claude

Anything you pass to `claude-pod` is run inside the container instead of bash. So this drops you directly into Claude in one command, and exits the container when Claude exits:

```sh
~/tools/claude-pod/claude-pod claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Pair with aliases for whichever style you prefer:

```sh
alias cp=~/tools/claude-pod/claude-pod                                       # shell first
alias cc='~/tools/claude-pod/claude-pod claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'  # claude directly
```

The shell-first form is more flexible (run `npm install`, dev server, tests, then `claude`), so it stays the default.

## What is and isn't isolated

**Safe from Claude:**
- Everything outside the project folder you launched from. `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.zshrc`, browser data, other projects — all unreachable.
- The host shell. No way to execute commands on your host machine.

**Still exposed:**
- The project folder itself, including any `.env` files in it.
- The network. Code in the container can reach the internet, so a malicious payload could exfiltrate the project contents or burn your Anthropic API quota.
- Your Anthropic login (stored in `~/.claude-pod/` on the host, separate from any host Claude install, shared across sandboxed projects).

**Where Claude can actually write** — two paths, both intentional bind mounts:
- The project folder, bind-mounted at the same path inside the container (`$PWD:$PWD`). Edits land on your host's disk directly, no copy.
- `~/.claude-pod/` on the host, mounted at `/home/node/.claude`. Holds the auth token and session history.

Everywhere else Claude writes is either in the container's ephemeral filesystem (discarded on exit thanks to `--rm`) or simply has no path to land at — the Linux kernel's mount namespace makes any other host directory invisible to the container. Symlinks inside the project folder pointing to `~/.ssh` or `/etc/passwd` appear broken for the same reason: those targets aren't mounted, so the container can't see them.

The tradeoff: the worst case becomes "something bad happens to one project folder," which is recoverable from git, instead of "my entire home directory is exposed."

## Customizing

The image is intentionally minimal: `node:lts-slim` + `git` + `curl` + `less` + Claude Code. Nothing language-specific. Anything your projects need (Python, build tools, other toolchains) you add yourself — edit the `Dockerfile` and re-run `./install.sh`.

**More ports**

Add another line to `claude-pod`:

```sh
-p 127.0.0.1:5173:5173 \
```

**Python**

Edit the `apt-get install` line in `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
... git ca-certificates curl less python3 python3-pip python3-venv ...
```

**Native compilation** (e.g. `bcrypt`, `node-gyp`, Python C extensions)

```dockerfile
... git ca-certificates curl less build-essential ...
```

**Other language toolchains** (Go, Rust, Java, etc.)

Add a separate `RUN` line below the `apt-get` block. Example for Rust:

```dockerfile
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain stable
```

After any change, re-run `./install.sh` to rebuild.

## Side effects outside the project folder

Everything this repo causes to exist outside the project you launch it from:

- `~/.claude-pod/` on your host — auth token, settings, and per-project session/conversation history (transcripts can include code snippets and command output Claude saw). Auth and settings are shared across projects (one login, ever); session history lives under `~/.claude-pod/projects/<encoded-host-path>/`, one folder per project, using the same encoding host-Claude uses — so if you ever switch to a host install, you can copy the folders over and keep your transcripts. This is *not* a host Claude install; it's a state directory for the container's Claude, kept on the host so it survives restarts.
- Docker image `claude-pod` (~600 MB) and its layers, plus the `node:lts-slim` base image, in Docker's image store.
- Docker build cache from `apt-get` and `npm install` steps.
- Outbound network during build: Docker Hub, Debian apt mirrors, npm registry. During runtime: `api.anthropic.com` and whatever your project code reaches (network is unrestricted).
- While a session is running: one container process, port `3000` bound on `127.0.0.1`.

No `sudo`, no writes to `/usr/local/`, `/etc/`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/Library/`, your existing `~/.claude/`, or anywhere else on the host.

## Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes `~/.claude-pod/` and the `claude-pod` image after confirmation. Tells you exactly what it isn't touching (`node:lts-slim`, build cache, this repo) and how to clean those up yourself.

## Notes

- If your project has a host-built `node_modules`, delete it and reinstall inside the container — native binaries don't cross from host OS to container Linux.
- First launch of `claude` will print a login URL. Open it in your host browser, paste back the code; the session persists in `~/.claude-pod/` for next time.
